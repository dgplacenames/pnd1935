INTRODUCTION
IN compiling this list of names, the plan adopted was to go through the 6 in. map of the county and make a list of all names, excluding such as were modern or of no particular interest. In searching through reference books other names were found which have since disappeared, but which can be roughly placed by the context. No attempt has been made to deal with names in the towns, as these deserve special treatment by someone with local knowledge; further, names in the neighbourhood of towns have been treated with suspicion owing to the habit of giving an old name fancy name to a modern house.
Owing to its geographical position, the Place Names of Dumfriesshire offer a very interesting ground for study, as we find specimens of nearly every early language, but in considering them it must be remembered that it is often impossible to sav whether a name is really Old English or not, as old Broad Scots embodied many words that are identical, or nearly so, with Old English. I have classified them as Old English because that is the source from which the name is ultimately derived, even though its application to the individual place may be comparatively modern.
Omitting for the moment River names, the older languages, British and Welsh, occur mostly, as might be expected, in the wilder and more hilly parts of the county, where the later settlers did not at first penetrate, and, when they did so, adopted the names they found in use.
The names of the rivers are the oldest of all, and in most cases defy interpretation.
The great bulk of the names are either Norse or Gaelic,

and can be divided as follows—Norse parishes, i.e., where the majority of the names are of Norse origin, are, Annan, Applegarth, Canonbie, Cummertrees, Dalton, Dornock, Dryfesdale, Gretna, Half-Morton, Hoddam, Kirkpatrick-Fleming, Langholm, Lochmaben, Middlebie, Mouswald, Ruthwell, St. Mungo, Tundergarth. The rest of the county, and especially Nithsdale, are Gaelic. The following figures give the proportion of each language (obviously modern names are not included).

A study of the map shows that the Norse element is confined entirely to the area along the shore and part way up Annandale and Eskdale. Further, it is clear that the northern and western boundaries of this area correspond with the boggy ground reaching from the shore along the Lochar Moss and the low-lying ground north of Lochmaben, where the Ae and Kinnel join the Annan, and then north along the Annan itself. It then turns East, avoiding the most wild and hilly parts of the county.
It is a well known fact that Cumberland and Westmor-

land were the centre of a large Norse colony whose place names are very common everywhere. Looking at the distribution in Dumfriesshire, the inference seems to be that the Norse population at first came from the South and advanced till it reached the boggy area. Even now this belt of land is a formidable obstacle, and if we picture its condition 1200 years ago, before the days of any drainage, it will be seen that it formed a very strong natural defence against probable attacks from the hills, where the natives, the natural enemies of the Norsemen, would be living.
The nature of the names gives a fairly clear impression of what the country looked like in old days. The rivers were probably bordered by wide marches, and their actual banks would be difficult of access except in a few places, hence we find places which have been known as fords from time immemorial. The hills were covered with scrub, mostly alder, birch, and oak, and, where they now appear soft, they would be more or less impassable bogs. The scrubby growth on the hills is confirmed by the layers of birch roots in the peat, and occasionally a larger tree or tree-root comes to light. The skeleton of an ox was found some 25 years ago in a Flow in Half-Morton at a depth of 8 feet. The commonest trees mentioned are alder, ash, birch, holly, and oak; crops were mostly barley and rye; the only animals now extinct were wolves.
Some names show the nationality of the owners or occupants—Dumbretton, The Briton’s ridge (Annan); Frenchland (Moffat); Archbank, the Irishman’s bank (Moffat); Glensaxon (Westerkirk).
There are a certain number of names, obviously of fairly modern origin, which show the manners of the times, such as “ Murder ” and “ Blood.” It is impossible to try and solve the origin of these names, as, so often, a legend has been built round them which may have no connection with the origin though, no doubt, in some cases there is a foundation of fact.

INTRODUCTION
A curious feature is the way in which certain names always have “the” prefixed to them. Though in some cases it is clearly connected with the meaning of the old name, it would be dangerous to generalise from a limited number. A complete list of such places might give a clue to the reason.
About 1800 there appears to have been a tendency to modernise some of the old names. Presumably people were becoming more educated and thought the old names were dialect. An instance is High Stenries, Half-Morton, which was so called (or rather Stenries) back in 1600, but was modernised to High Stone Ridge. There is a map of the county, dated 1828, which shows several instances of this custom. The same changes may be seen now between the Ordnance Map and the Valuation Roll. In other cases the name has been slightly corrupted and then a legend built round the new name, for instance, Alfornought, Middlebie, represents (G) all fornocht, naked rock, and dates back to 1600 at least, but the local legend is that the land was put into cultivation about 1800, but went back to hillground, so that the trouble was “all for nought”; it is even sometimes spoken of as “All for nothing.”
My thanks are due to Professor W. J. Watson, LL.D., for much valuable help in interpreting some of the Gaelic names, and to Mr Shirley for the loan of books; there are also many others who have given me help in various ways to whom I wish to express my gratitude.

NOTES
1.	MEASUREMENTS OF LAND.
Merkland. The measuring of land by rental is a custom borrowed from the Norse, the unit being the Ounceland. This is rarely met with but the smaller amounts are quite common. In an ounce of silver there were held to be 18 to 20 dwts, and penny lands abound as do smaller amounts down to the farthing.
Oxgang Cowgang. A measure of land, originally the amount which an ox team could plough in a year. This definition is given in the Wiltshire Doomsday, and presumably means the amount they could plough in the ordinary way of cultivation. It varies from 10 to 25 acres according to the nature of the soil. (EPN Yorks, N.R.).
Bovate. Same as an Oxgang.
Hide. A holding which supported an ordinary free household, in the Wiltshire Doomsday it is given as about 120-160 acres.
Davach. G. dabach, was not so much a measure of land as the amount of land required to support so many head of cattle (CPN).
